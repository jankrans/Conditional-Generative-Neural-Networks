abstract = {Greater direct electrification of end-use sectors with a higher share of renewables is one of the pillars to power a carbon-neutral society by 2050. However, in contrast to conventional power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty raising challenges for their interaction with power systems. Scenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have become a vital tool to equip decision-makers. This paper presents to the power systems forecasting practitioners a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing flows, to produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts that are crucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength of this technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution of the underlying process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology is competitive with other state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind, solar power, and load scenarios are properly compared in terms of forecast value by considering the case study of an energy retailer and quality using several complementary metrics. The numerical experiments are simple and easily reproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners to test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding on electricity markets, scheduling power systems with high renewable energy sources penetration, energy management of virtual power plan or microgrids, and unit commitment.}

# Dependencies
Two libraries are required to implement the normalizing flows models used in the study:
* https://github.com/AWehenkel/Normalizing-Flows -> to access the repositories lib and model
* https://github.com/AWehenkel/UMNN -> to implement the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks normalizing flows

If you make use of the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks code, please cite the paper:

Concerning the forecast value assessment: the Python Gurobi library is used to implement the algorithms in Python 3.7, and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) 9.0.2 to solve all the optimization problems.


## Data
The GEFcom2014/data folder contains the GEFcom2014 dataset: load, wind, and PV tracks.


## Generative models
The GEFcom2014/models folder contains the generative models in the following folders:
* GAN: generative adversarial networks
* VAE: variational autoencoders
* NFs: normalizing flows (affine and unconstrained monotonic neural networks)
* GC: gaussian copula
* RAND: random

Then, inside each folder, there is a Python file to run the model. For instance, for the NFs:

```bash
nf_autoregressive.py 
```

For each model, the structure of the Python file is similar. 

First, select the track by indicating the track considered:

```bash
tag = 'load'  # pv, wind, load
```

Second, specify the number of scenarios and quantiles to be generated per day: 

```bash
n_s = 100 # number of scenarios
N_q = 99 # number of quantiles
```

The hyper-parameters of the models for each track are already specified but can be modified. By default, they are set to the values of the paper.

Finally, by running the Python file, the model is trained and generates scenarios and quantiles over the learning, validation, and testing set.

Note: the function

```bash
quantiles_and_evaluation(dir_path=dir_path, s_VS=s_VS, s_TEST=s_TEST, N_q=N_q, df_y_VS=df_y_VS, df_y_TEST=df_y_TEST, name=name, ymax_plf=ymax_plf, ylim_crps=ylim_crps, tag=tag, nb_zones=nb_zones)
```
allows computing some metrics over the validation and testing sets.

## Forecast quality
The GEFcom2014/forecast_quality folder contains the Python files to evaluate the forecast quality of the generative models. The scenarios to be evaluated are located in the folder GEFcom2014/forecast_quality/scenarios. This folder contains the scenarios per generative model: GAN, GC, NFs, etc. 

For instance, GEFcom2014/forecast_quality/scenarios/gan comprises scenarios over the load, wind, and PV tracks over the testing set.

The file:
```bash
CRPS_QS_all_tracks.py
```
allows computing the CRPS, QS, and reliability diagram metrics for all tracks and models.

The file:
```bash
CRPS_QS_DM_test.py
```
computes DM-statistical test of the CRPS and QS metrics for all models and tracks.

The file:
```bash
ES_VS_metrics.py 
```
computes the ES, VS multivariate metrics for all tracks and models. It also computes the DM-statistical test.

The file:
```bash
scenario_correlations.py
```
computes the correlation matrices between scenarios for a given day.

The file:
```bash
clf_metric.py
```
contains the classifier-based metric. Note: scenarios over the learning set are required to fit the classifier. Due to the size of the files, they are not included in the GEFcom2014/forecast_quality/scenarios folder. They need to be generated and included in this folder.

## Forecast value
The GEFcom2014/forecast_value/ folder contains the Python files to evaluate the forecast value of the generative models. It uses the retailer energy case study to bid optimally on a day-ahead basis by solving a stochastic optimization problem.

The file:
```bash
bidding_retailer.py 
```
computes the day-ahead bids for all models and the corresponding profits.

The parameters:
```bash
nb_s = 50 # number of scenarios considered per stochastic optimization problem
soc_max = 1 # battery storage capacity
dad_price = 100  # euros /MWh
q_pos = 2
q_neg = 2
pos_imb = q_pos * dad_price  # euros /MWh
neg_imb = q_neg * dad_price  # euros /MWh
```
are set to the default values used in the paper.

Warning: the Gurobi Python API must be activated to use this file.
